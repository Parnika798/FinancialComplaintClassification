# Consumer Complaint Classification Project

This project analyzes and classifies consumer complaints. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), text translation, and training a machine learning model for classification.

## 💾 Dataset

**The data files are not included in this repository due to their large size.**

To run this project, you must download the necessary files and place them in the `/data/` folder. The `src/config.py` file is already set up to find them there.

### 1. Raw Data

This is the original, unprocessed dataset.

* **File:** `consumercomplaints.xlsx`
* **Download:** **[<<< PASTE YOUR LINK to the raw Kaggle/data page HERE >>>]**

### 2. Cleaned Data

This dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned by the `01-data-cleaning.ipynb` notebook. If you don't want to run the cleaning notebook yourself, you can download the final file here.

* **File:** `cleaned_complaints.xlsx`
* **Download:** https://kaggle.com/datasets/6f0867ba82eaed80e6b28448385a4b7723b7d0c8abb0b8caeff64ceaa1e20563

### 3. Translated Data

This dataset contains a sample of complaints translated into multiple languages for bilingual modeling.

* **File:** `sample_top5_translated.csv`
